There were a dozen of us in total, and we rented out one big house on the beach to stay in. Originally the plan was to spend most of our days in Puarto Vallarta. But Riley and I happened upon Sayulita on our first day and ended up going back every day thereafter."

				"subtitle": "Sayulita",
				"body": "Sayulita is just the cutest little beach town. Our first couple days there were spent surfing, laying in the sun, and eating tacos. But, on our final day we convinced our whole group to come out to the town. As a group we explored the tourist market. We were lucky enough to find a really kind lady in the market who was selling blankets and, between us, bought some twenty blankets from her. We were thrilled with the blankets (mine is red!) and she was happy for the business. Afterward, we rented snorkels and found a rocky part of the beach. Unfortunately, the visibility was poor, and the most interesting areas were almost in the surf. This was my first time snorkeling and, turns out, breathing under water is kinda freaky. That, plus the mediocre visibility, and the abundant, often surprising, rocks was enough to make the experience more psychological trail than pleasant vacation activity. Afterward I was adamant that I'd never go again, but, my views have softened in the months since, and perhaps under calmer conditions I'll try snorkeling once again."

It had a pool, a cute little path to a private beach, kayaks in the garage that we could use, and air conditioning! Plus, we hired a chef to come to the house and make our evening meals. Needless to say, we were vacationing in style. The big house made a great home-base. The first night we were all pretty pooped and crashed early after a taco dinner. But Saturday evening, after a resplendent meal, we took advantage of our space by playing 'Two Rooms and a Boom' which is a large-group game where teams are split into two different rooms, and through conniving and cleverness try to sabatoge the other team. We played half a dozen rounds, and finaly, during the last round my team won! We stumbled to victory by utterly failing to communicate or strategize. We could have easily controlled our room in the first round but we didn't realize we had a majority, and, essentially through luck, won in the final exchange. Our final evening at the house was a bit quieter, we spent our last sunset playing in the pool and enjoying coconut drinks."

We had delicious marinated lamb served over rice. After that, it was a ferry across the marina to see the old-town and gold district. Finally, our evening culminated in a visit to Dubai Mall, the Burj Khalifa, and the Dubai Fountains."

			},
			{
				"body": "Our first night Johannah took us across town to meet some other Peace Corps volunteers who were back in the capitol for the holidays. We took our first 'line taxi' to get there. And let's take a brief asside here to explain line taxi's. These are little vans, almost all Toyotas, which drive a specific route. Unlike busses they aren't public service and have no particular schedule. Each van has two oporators, one is the driver, the other is the caller, who's responsible for identifying people to pick up, collecting fares, and telling the driver when to make a stop. So, we walked down the block from our apartment to the nearest thoroughfare. This was a particularly busy route so there was already a clump of people waiting for the taxi. Presently one pulled up. There were some folks already in the taxi and probably another 5 or 6 people waiting with us, but we all shuffled in anyhow. As mentioned, these vans are small. But the inside is cleverly configured to fit as many people as possible. A few days later I had the wherewithall to count, and we figured that a typical van would fit 17 passengers when full. Though Johannah pointed out that overfilling beyond that is common during rush hour. But back to our first night, once aboard the van the driver sets off and the caller turned around to collect fairs, Johannah handled this for us that first time. Cost is typically 1.5 Birr (at the time conversion was 22 birr / 1 usd). We paid foreigner prices usually, but that still rarely exceeded 3 birr (translation note: Riley and I eventually learned all the numbers up to twenty or so, but the one we learned best was 'sost' meaning 3, because we'd frequently have to specify that there were three of us when paying for taxis). Presently, Johanna called for a stop, the van dove through traffic to the curb where we were deposited."
			},
			{
				"body": "At long last we'd made it to the old foreigner neighborhood, the typical haunt for expats and visitors. We met up with Johannah's Peace Corps friends at the Black Rose, a darkly lit western bar just off the main road. It was here that Riley and I found our first comforting familiarities of home, for the menu included Heinikens and screwdrivers."
			},
			{
				"body": "I was surprised to learn that Johannah's assignment for Peace Corps was somewhat unusual. She's based in a small town of about 500 people, located outside of Metu. This very rural and her role is part english teacher, part sustainable farmer, and part community member. In many ways her most significant responsibility is to embody America and foreigners generally for this community. By contrast most of the other volunteers are based in larger cities. Several were in Addis itself, others in Jimma and Adama. As well as a different setting these locations also usually had a more singular assignment focus, often operating as a volunteer at an existing school or organization."
			},
			{
				"subtitle": "Day Two",
				"body": "Our second day was mostly rest, we walked to a couple nearby markets, and had our first 'bunna de jebena' traditional Ethiopian coffee (translation note: bunna means coffee, jebena is the Ethiopian kettle used to make coffee). This we got from a street-side stand, as is customary. The stand we went to was operated by a young woman. There was a tarp overhead to give us shade, and we pulled up little stools around one of the short tables. She put a fresh jebena on the stove. After a span the coffee was ready and she came over to pour us each our first cups. Each cup is quite small, probably about 3 oz. The coffee is extremely strong, but there's a cup of sugar. Johannah asked for no sugar, but I took the default option, which turned out to be three spoonfulls of sugar per glass. After finishing our first glass, we were poured a second, then a third. Three glasses is expected when getting bunna, and most pricing is for a three-glass sitting."
			},
			{
				"body": "Later during our second day we went to the Red Terror Museum, a few blocks from our apartment. The Red Terror was violent political conflict in Ethiopia starting in 1977 and continuing for two years which lead to the death of an estimated 500,000 persons. It closely followed the deposition of Haile Selassie. I won't further summarize those events here because there are much more complete and accurate narratives to be found elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the Museum presented the sense of fear during that conflict, along with stories of individual tragedy which were entirely moving. If you should so happen to be in Addis, I highly recommend visiting this Museum."
			},
			{
				"subtitle": "Mt. Entoto",
				"body": "Day three, and we wake up early to travel up to Mt. Entoto. The mountain is fairly close to the city but getting there still proves tricky. In the end we take a tram to a public bus terminal, from there we bus up to Shiromeda, a market halfway up Entoto, then finally catch a line taxi up to the mountain park proper. The park is huge, and we didn't actually make it to the summit. Instead we speant our time reclining in a prairie and catching up with Johannah."

				"body": "We arrived into Awassa around midday after a 6 hour bus ride. First stop was the beachfront and food. We stumbled into a restaurant which served exactly two dishes, both of which were fried fish. Riley isn't especially fond of fish, so she focused on the bread cakes that came with the meal and brought forth a CliffBar from the depths of one of our bags. But there was also good news, while at the restaurant one of the owners, Shiru, came over and introduced himself to us. We chatted as we ate and he was excited to meet tourists, and especially excited to talk with Johannah, as she was living in country long term. When it transpired that we didn't have particular plans for the next day, Shiru offered to take the day off and show us around town. I was a bit worried that this would be an imposition for him, but he insisted and, frankly, we were happy to have a guide."
			},
			{
				"body": "After meeting Shiru and eating our fill of fish we wondered around in search of Zebra Hostel, which had been suggested by another Peace Corps volunteer as the best place to stay in Awassa. And we found it just a block up the street from the beachfront. We nabbed an available room and took a nap after our long morning."
			},
			{
				"subtitle": "Monkeys and Fish",
				"body": "Day two started with some early morning Bunna de Jebena out front of the hostel. We met Shiru there and he gave us a rundown of the plan for the day. First stop: Monkeys at Amora Gedel Park. The park is full of a couple species of Monkeys. The photos above show us hanging out with the larger of the species, but there were also some littler monotone-grey ones. Turns out the park is also a popular place for swimming, washing clothes, and weddings, we saw several stages set up for ceremonies that would be happening later in the day."
			},
			{
				"body": "Just around the corner from the park is the daily fish market. Shiru did some fast talking to get us in here (normally you're required to hire a guide and pay some tourist fees). At the market fishers bring in their haul from a night on the lake and sell it to restaurant owners like Shiru. Off to one side are gutting and cleanning stations which attract the local birds, some of which are a good four feet tall. Seeing these tall, big beaked birds, it's suddenly not surprising that they're descended from dinosaurs. There is something vaguely alien about the way they look at you."
			},
			{
				"body": "Last stop at the fish market was a meal of fish soup. Shiru explained that this chef was renouned for his soup, to which some miraculous healings had been attributed. It was without a doubt the best fish soup I've had."
			},
			{
				"subtitle": "The Market",
				"body": "We made it to the Awassa general market just after lunch. This market deals in all non-fish goods. There's clothes stands, kitchen suply shops, grains, fresh foods, spices, coffee, arcade games, etc. Essentially, anything one would need on a regular basis. All of the market was on open ground, trodden to packed dirt. Shops were built from local lumber, and covered with colorful fabric roofing to stave off the midday sun. In the center of the market most of the aisles were also covered, creating a cool shady shopping experience."
			},
			{
				"body": "I found a red shirt with a light floral pattern that I absolutely fell in love with at the market. We haggled with the seller, eventually talking them down from 500 Birr to a mere 275 Birr. This is undoubtably still tourist pricing but worth it for a fun shirt. We also walked through what amounts to the dicsount isle, clothing sold from tarps in an open space in the market, rather than from stalls like the one where I got my shirt. Nearby this open area were an array of foosball tables. I didn't have the courage to challenge the locals, not least because it would surely have ended with me loosing to an eight year old. Last stop in the market was a kitchen supply stand. This was clearly one of the more successful stands, as it was staffed by the owner and two assitants and there was still a line. But, we were able to flag down one of the assitants and I bought a Jebena for 50 Birr. As far as Shiru and Johannah could tell this is standard pricing for Jebenas. It's hard to express how refreshing it was not be quoted an absurd tourist price, and I wish I'd been better able to communicate my gratitude to the shop owner. Despite exchanging only a few words she is one of the people I think back to most frequently from this trip."

We stopped in Shashameni for lunch, evidently it is a rapidly growing buisiness and shipping hub for Southern Ethiopia."

				"body": "The park itself was marvelous. At first we just wandered about on the beach and admired the view over the lake. But presently a young man walked up and declared himself a guide for the park. He and Shiru chatted for a bit, and he ended up leading us around a bend to discover the hotsprings photoed above. Unlike the Yellowstone variety of hotspring which I was more familiar with, these bubbled up through soft sandy mud. Despite the soft soil the upwelling of hot water caused peculiar little formations in the mud. I got in a bit of trouble with the guide for stepping up the edge of one of the hotsprings to try to peer down into it. Evidently the edges are prone to giving way and duping the uncareful into the scalding water."
