And so we had the pleasure of seeing the beautiful old homes and rice fields around dawn and dusk, when we were some of the only tourists around. The above photo of the entire town was taken on an early morning venture into old-town, you can see some early-morning fog still clinging to the hillside above the town."

This museum related the former industries of this region of Japan. It turns out that this area was long held by the Koga tribe where they excelled at silk production. They later became producers of excelent black powder after same was introduced to Japan by a shipwrecked Portugese crew in the mid 1500's. All the while access to Shirakawa-go and surrounding areas was kept secure by mountains at their back and a river in front. The Koga tribe refused to bridge the river, prefering instead to limit passage into the region by constructing a cable-carriage. A reconstruction of this carriage is pictured above. And as far as this museum reported their security measures worked. The region remained in control of the Koga tribe until black powder lost relevance. Later this area experienced a resurgence from tourism."

After about ten minutes the docent of the exhibit allows everyone to stand and walk towards the rectangle. At this point the pitch dark room has become slightly more tractable. People apear as dark silhouettes against an ever-so-slightly not black backdrop. As we approach the grey rectange it remains intangible, it's edges sharpen but the thing itself feels impossible to focus on. Finally, upon reaching the front of the room we discover the rectangle to be not a thing, but an empty space in the far wall, how deep the space or how tall or how wide it is beyond that rectangular window is impossible to gauge. We lean forward, passing a hand, maybe an arm, through that invisible barrier into the space beyond, to affirm that what we fail to see we also fail to touch. We're allowed another moment the take in the view of this distanceless untouchable space before the docent asks us to file out the exit so the next group can come in."

The museum was in an old school house and the main collection was a huge library of Manga, which overflowed the central exhibition space and continued onto bookshelves scattered throughout the building. This collection was augmented by an exhibit which recalled (in Japanese and English) the history of Manga as well as the technical aspects of authoring and mass producing the works. One of our favorite sections had a stack of clear overhead sheets, each with a different facial feature (ex: there was a stack of a dozen different noses, another stack with eyes, another with hair styles).

There are some pretty stunning photos of the castle as the only building standing in a city mostly destroyed. And today Himeji stands as one of the largest and most impressive castles in Japan.

Gyeongbokgung is historically the primary palace for the royal family. The complex is huge. It was origionally built in the 1300's, but has been burned down and rebuild several times since then (destroyed in 1592 by Japanese army, mostly burned down during Japanese occupation 1910-1945). The pictures above, and much of the palace available for exploration was most recently rebuilt since the 1990's. The cement roof peaks are a minor tell of the recent reoncstruction. Some of the palace is still under construction, but it still took me two hours to explore the entire available area. Additionally, there was a guard changing ceremony while I was there. The ceremony actually reminded me somewhat of the Brittish changing of the guard at the royal palace. Similar amount of ceremony and traditional dress"
			},

				"body": "After Gyeongbokgung I stopped for lunch in Bukchon Hanok village. I happened to be there during lunch hour and so got to follow a bunch of businessmen from the Constitutional Court to a local restaurant. None of the wait staff spoke english, but they set me up at a traditional (sitting) table for a course of bulgogi. From watching other tables it _seems_ like there's a tradition for cheering for whomever takes the check, which I kinda like. It seems like a good way to handle going out for lunch with coworkers every day; allowing someone new to take the check each week, and providing a group acknowlegement of that contribution each time."
			},
			{
				"body": "After lunch I took a brief visit to Changdeokgung Palace. It turns out that Changdeokgung is pretty similar in it's architecture to Gyeongbokgung Palace, in part becuase buildings from Gyeongbokgung were used to rebuild Changdeokgung after it was burned down in the early 1900's. Given the similar style, and the hours I'd spent at Gyeongbokgung in the morning, I cut this visit short and made my way back towards Bukchon village. There I happened up on Double Cup Coffee, which turned out to be amazing. There's a photo above, it's a four story coffee shop, the counter is on the main floor, but there's seatting spaces above for several floors. The styling was all warm, wooded study/library theme. And there was AC! I realize I haven't specifically talked about this yet, but Seoul is _hot_. I've been sweatting all day; it's worse than NYC ever was in the summer."

We were thrilled with the blankets (mine is red!) and she was happy for the business. Afterward, we rented snorkels and found a rocky part of the beach. Unfortunately, the visibility was poor, and the most interesting areas were almost in the surf. This was my first time snorkeling and, turns out, breathing under water is kinda freaky. That, plus the mediocre visibility, and the abundant, often surprising, rocks was enough to make the experience more psychological trail than pleasant vacation activity. Afterward I was adamant that I'd never go again, but, my views have softened in the months since, and perhaps under calmer conditions I'll try snorkeling once again."

Needless to say, we were vacationing in style. The big house made a great home-base. The first night we were all pretty pooped and crashed early after a taco dinner. But Saturday evening, after a resplendent meal, we took advantage of our space by playing 'Two Rooms and a Boom' which is a large-group game where teams are split into two different rooms, and through conniving and cleverness try to sabatoge the other team. We played half a dozen rounds, and finaly, during the last round my team won! We stumbled to victory by utterly failing to communicate or strategize. We could have easily controlled our room in the first round but we didn't realize we had a majority, and, essentially through luck, won in the final exchange. Our final evening at the house was a bit quieter, we spent our last sunset playing in the pool and enjoying coconut drinks."

			{
				"body": "Our first night Johannah took us across town to meet some other Peace Corps volunteers who were back in the capitol for the holidays. We took our first 'line taxi' to get there. And let's take a brief asside here to explain line taxi's. These are little vans, almost all Toyotas, which drive a specific route. Unlike busses they aren't public service and have no particular schedule. Each van has two oporators, one is the driver, the other is the caller, who's responsible for identifying people to pick up, collecting fares, and telling the driver when to make a stop. So, we walked down the block from our apartment to the nearest thoroughfare. This was a particularly busy route so there was already a clump of people waiting for the taxi. Presently one pulled up. There were some folks already in the taxi and probably another 5 or 6 people waiting with us, but we all shuffled in anyhow. As mentioned, these vans are small. But the inside is cleverly configured to fit as many people as possible. A few days later I had the wherewithall to count, and we figured that a typical van would fit 17 passengers when full. Though Johannah pointed out that overfilling beyond that is common during rush hour. But back to our first night, once aboard the van the driver sets off and the caller turned around to collect fairs, Johannah handled this for us that first time. Cost is typically 1.5 Birr (at the time conversion was 22 birr / 1 usd). We paid foreigner prices usually, but that still rarely exceeded 3 birr (translation note: Riley and I eventually learned all the numbers up to twenty or so, but the one we learned best was 'sost' meaning 3, because we'd frequently have to specify that there were three of us when paying for taxis). Presently, Johanna called for a stop, the van dove through traffic to the curb where we were deposited."
			},
			{
				"body": "At long last we'd made it to the old foreigner neighborhood, the typical haunt for expats and visitors. We met up with Johannah's Peace Corps friends at the Black Rose, a darkly lit western bar just off the main road. It was here that Riley and I found our first comforting familiarities of home, for the menu included Heinikens and screwdrivers."
			},
			{
				"body": "I was surprised to learn that Johannah's assignment for Peace Corps was somewhat unusual. She's based in a small town of about 500 people, located outside of Metu. This very rural and her role is part english teacher, part sustainable farmer, and part community member. In many ways her most significant responsibility is to embody America and foreigners generally for this community. By contrast most of the other volunteers are based in larger cities. Several were in Addis itself, others in Jimma and Adama. As well as a different setting these locations also usually had a more singular assignment focus, often operating as a volunteer at an existing school or organization."
			},
			{
				"subtitle": "Day Two",
				"body": "Our second day was mostly rest, we walked to a couple nearby markets, and had our first 'bunna de jebena' traditional Ethiopian coffee (translation note: bunna means coffee, jebena is the Ethiopian kettle used to make coffee). This we got from a street-side stand, as is customary. The stand we went to was operated by a young woman. There was a tarp overhead to give us shade, and we pulled up little stools around one of the short tables. She put a fresh jebena on the stove. After a span the coffee was ready and she came over to pour us each our first cups. Each cup is quite small, probably about 3 oz. The coffee is extremely strong, but there's a cup of sugar. Johannah asked for no sugar, but I took the default option, which turned out to be three spoonfulls of sugar per glass. After finishing our first glass, we were poured a second, then a third. Three glasses is expected when getting bunna, and most pricing is for a three-glass sitting."
			},
			{
				"body": "Later during our second day we went to the Red Terror Museum, a few blocks from our apartment. The Red Terror was violent political conflict in Ethiopia starting in 1977 and continuing for two years which lead to the death of an estimated 500,000 persons. It closely followed the deposition of Haile Selassie. I won't further summarize those events here because there are much more complete and accurate narratives to be found elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the Museum presented the sense of fear during that conflict, along with stories of individual tragedy which were entirely moving. If you should so happen to be in Addis, I highly recommend visiting this Museum."

In the end we take a tram to a public bus terminal, from there we bus up to Shiromeda, a market halfway up Entoto, then finally catch a line taxi up to the mountain park proper. The park is huge, and we didn't actually make it to the summit. Instead we speant our time reclining in a prairie and catching up with Johannah."

We stumbled into a restaurant which served exactly two dishes, both of which were fried fish. Riley isn't especially fond of fish, so she focused on the bread cakes that came with the meal and brought forth a CliffBar from the depths of one of our bags. But there was also good news, while at the restaurant one of the owners, Shiru, came over and introduced himself to us. We chatted as we ate and he was excited to meet tourists, and especially excited to talk with Johannah, as she was living in country long term. When it transpired that we didn't have particular plans for the next day, Shiru offered to take the day off and show us around town. I was a bit worried that this would be an imposition for him, but he insisted and, frankly, we were happy to have a guide."

First stop: Monkeys at Amora Gedel Park. The park is full of a couple species of Monkeys. The photos above show us hanging out with the larger of the species, but there were also some littler monotone-grey ones. Turns out the park is also a popular place for swimming, washing clothes, and weddings, we saw several stages set up for ceremonies that would be happening later in the day."
			},
			{
				"body": "Just around the corner from the park is the daily fish market. Shiru did some fast talking to get us in here (normally you're required to hire a guide and pay some tourist fees). At the market fishers bring in their haul from a night on the lake and sell it to restaurant owners like Shiru. Off to one side are gutting and cleanning stations which attract the local birds, some of which are a good four feet tall. Seeing these tall, big beaked birds, it's suddenly not surprising that they're descended from dinosaurs. There is something vaguely alien about the way they look at you."
			},

There's clothes stands, kitchen suply shops, grains, fresh foods, spices, coffee, arcade games, etc. Essentially, anything one would need on a regular basis. All of the market was on open ground, trodden to packed dirt. Shops were built from local lumber, and covered with colorful fabric roofing to stave off the midday sun. In the center of the market most of the aisles were also covered, creating a cool shady shopping experience."
			},
			{
				"body": "I found a red shirt with a light floral pattern that I absolutely fell in love with at the market. We haggled with the seller, eventually talking them down from 500 Birr to a mere 275 Birr. This is undoubtably still tourist pricing but worth it for a fun shirt. We also walked through what amounts to the dicsount isle, clothing sold from tarps in an open space in the market, rather than from stalls like the one where I got my shirt. Nearby this open area were an array of foosball tables. I didn't have the courage to challenge the locals, not least because it would surely have ended with me loosing to an eight year old. Last stop in the market was a kitchen supply stand. This was clearly one of the more successful stands, as it was staffed by the owner and two assitants and there was still a line. But, we were able to flag down one of the assitants and I bought a Jebena for 50 Birr. As far as Shiru and Johannah could tell this is standard pricing for Jebenas. It's hard to express how refreshing it was not be quoted an absurd tourist price, and I wish I'd been better able to communicate my gratitude to the shop owner. Despite exchanging only a few words she is one of the people I think back to most frequently from this trip."

Unlike the Yellowstone variety of hotspring which I was more familiar with, these bubbled up through soft sandy mud. Despite the soft soil the upwelling of hot water caused peculiar little formations in the mud. I got in a bit of trouble with the guide for stepping up the edge of one of the hotsprings to try to peer down into it. Evidently the edges are prone to giving way and duping the uncareful into the scalding water."
